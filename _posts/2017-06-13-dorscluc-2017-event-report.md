<a href="https://2017.dorscluc.org" target="_blank">DORS/CLUC</a> is a regional open source software conference in Zagreb, Croatia. It happens every year at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, targeting Linux users and professionals. I have attended the conference for the first time about two weeks ago, and I would like to share my notes from the conference with you.

<a href="https://getfedora.org/" target="_blank">Fedora</a> got two talks this year:

  1. Fedora and VR glass by [Gergely Rákosi](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Rgeri77 "User:Rgeri77")
  2. Fedora Modularity by me, [Adam Samalik](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Asamalik "User:Asamalik")

There is also a <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/DORS-CLUC_2017" target="_blank">Fedora wiki page for the event</a>.

## How Adam did?

Let me give you some metrics of me being at the conference&#8230; I was using Twitter as my communication channel and to get some data about my presence.

The official <a href="https://twitter.com/dorscluc" target="_blank">DORS/CLUC Twitter account</a> did about 60 tweets the first day, 10 were retweets, and I got 4 of them.

<a href="https://twitter.com/adsamalik/status/869802194614317056" target="_blank">My most popular tweet</a> by views got about 5000 views during the first 5 hours &#8211; before my talk, about 7600 for the whole duration of the conference, and 10133 at the time of writing this post. Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/fedora" target="_blank">@fedora</a> and others for retweeting!

<a href="https://twitter.com/adsamalik/status/869929232847302656" target="_blank">The most retweeted one</a> was about Gergley&#8217;s VR talk and got 12 retweets, 15 likes, and about 2500 views.

My talk was attended by roughly 50 &#8211; 80 people (I&#8217;m still not able to count people quickly enough) which was about the average. The conference had only one track, so there was not much choice anyway. I got a few questions right after the talks and some interesting discussions afterwards.

At the end of my talk, they <a href="https://twitter.com/dorscluc/status/869889284366622720" target="_blank">tweeted about the Modularity YouTube channel</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dorscluc/status/869890056617701376" target="_blank">invited people to contribute</a>.

I have published my slides at SlideShare: <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/Adamamalk/fedora-modularity-dorscluc-2017" target="_blank">Fedora Modularity at DORS/CLUC 2017</a>

Apart from the the Modularity talk, I also talked to people about Fedora and did four demos of the system on my laptop. One included installing and demonstrating KDE to a Windows user who really loved the customization options and installed Fedora KDE spin on his laptop later that evening.
