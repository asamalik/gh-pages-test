  Last week, I visited the <a href="https://flocktofedora.org/">Flock 2016 conference</a> in the beautiful city of Krakow. And it was brilliant!
</p>

<p class="p1">
  If you asked me about three most important things I took from the conference, I would probably tell you the following:
</p>

<p class="p1">
  First: I met a lot of interesting people. And I think this is the most important thing about any conference. I finally had a chance to meet people I knew before over email and irc (or at least knew they exist) and had a chance to talk to them personally. From my experience, it was always much easier to work remotely with someone I know or at least met before for a while. It makes conversations much more comfortable, especially over IRC where you can&#8217;t express or see emotions of the other side. I would love to do this more often! ðŸ™‚
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Second: I talked to many people and a lotÂ of them were not from Red Hat!Â Also, during the keynote on Tuesday morning we saw some statistics including a chart showing that <a href="https://twitter.com/adsamalik/status/760375569649401856">less than 1/3 of contributors to Fedora are RedÂ Hatters</a>. Fedora is a true open source project!
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Third: The <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Modularity">Modularity project</a> I currently work on seems accepted by people. I didn&#8217;t hear anyone to say &#8220;no&#8221; and people seemed very interested in the topic. Both talk and workshop hadÂ full rooms, and there were a lot of questions asked. BTW, there is a demo on YouTube showing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK4Id8TKydQ">how Modularity looks from the user perspective</a>.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Finally, big thanks to the the people who organized the event! You did a really great job. Everything just worked and it was a very nice experience!
