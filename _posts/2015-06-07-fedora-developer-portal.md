I&#8217;m starting a new project called Fedora Developer Portal. It would be a new place for developers looking for information about stuff that is packaged in Fedora or searching new features and projects they haven&#8217;t heard about. And there are some really great! For example, do you know about [Developer Assistant](http://devassistant.org/), [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) or [Copr](https://copr.fedoraproject.org/)?

There would be two main types of information that you will get from the website:

The first will help you to **explore**. Imagine that you are a student of computer science or an existing developer. You might be looking for the best Linux distribution that will fit your needs or you have already chosen Fedora, but you don&#8217;t know every feature it might offer for you as a developer. There are great tools, technology and resources that will help you to have your project done, running and distributed to the users.

The second will help you **understand how things are packaged**. There are plenty of components, libraries and frameworks already packaged in Fedora for languages like Python, Ruby, Perl or PHP. This might be the reason why you chose Fedora, because the collection is quite nice. You will learn how to install them and how to use and include them in your creations.

Both would be divided into five main categories:

  1. Developer Tools 
      * Developer Assistant, Vagrant, Docker, &#8230;
      * What tool could help you to develop?
  2. Technology 
      * Python, Ruby, Perl, PHP, &#8230;
      * Which technology should you use?
  3. Deployment 
      * Copr, Docker, Openshift, &#8230;
      * How to get it running and distribute it to users?
  4. Docker Images and Vagrant Boxes 
      * Virtual environments based on Fedora
  5. Blogs

Each section about every project would explain WHAT the project is about and HOW to use it/get it running. If there are some differences between the packaged version and upstream, it will explain what they are and why is that. It may also provide some examples or links to other useful resources.

The whole idea about this project is to provide a single place for new or existing Fedora developers that would help them to discover new projects and features they didn&#8217;t know before and to provide them with information about how things are packaged and how to use them on Fedora.

Have a look at the project&#8217;s wiki page: <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Websites/Developer>

Any ideas, opinions and feedback are welcome! Just leave a comment here. I&#8217;m looking forward to hearing from you!
