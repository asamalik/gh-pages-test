I wanted to try an interesting project called Jekyll &#8211; a static page generator. It consumes content in textual form like Markdown or Textile, Liquid templates, and HTML and CSS to generate static pages and blogs.

I should be able to install it with simple command:

<pre>$ <span class="command">gem install jekyll</span></pre>

But it wasn&#8217;t successful. What I&#8217;m going to do?

Good news for me is that I work on a project called Fedora Developer Portal! And there is a [repo for content](https://github.com/developer-portal/content/) with the Ruby section already created. It explains how to install Ruby, Gems, etc. I used that information and successfully installed Jekyll on my machine.

That&#8217;s one of the purposes of our new portal &#8211; to help people start with new (new for them) technology on Fedora.

### First Prototype is Here!

As you might have figured out from the introduction, and from the heading as well, the development slowly started! I just finished a [prototype](https://developer-phracek.rhcloud.com/) which is running on [developer-phracek.rhcloud.com](https://developer-phracek.rhcloud.com/).

Please keep in mind that this is just a prototype that offers very limited content and functionality. The content is not final and will change according to your feedback and ideas ðŸ™‚
