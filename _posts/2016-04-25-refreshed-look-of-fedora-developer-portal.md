I have just deployed a new version of <a href="https://developer.fedoraproject.org/" target="_blank">Fedora Developer Portal</a>. The most visible part is **refreshed look** with more uniform layout. I have also compressed all the images in titles (from ~1.2MB to ~50kB in average) &#8211; so the loading should be much faster.

There is also **new section** called <a href="https://developer.fedoraproject.org/start.html" target="_blank">Start a project</a>. This section contains/will contain content from a problem-to-be-solved perspective like &#8216;Create a Website&#8217; or &#8216;Work with Arduino&#8217;. This new section is the opposite of <a href="https://developer.fedoraproject.org/tech.html" target="_blank">Languages and Databases</a>, which is a &#8216;language-specific&#8217; section.

As I have already mentioned, the new section is partly empty. This is another new feature &#8211;** **we have also published a selection of unfinished/empty pages, that we would like to include. **And this is your turn!** You can help us by contributing content. All information is about contributing is on our <a href="http://developer-portal.github.io/" target="_blank">new site for contributors</a> &#8211; also linked from the portal.

If you would like to get involved, get in touch with us on <a href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/developer-portal.lists.fedoraproject.org/" target="_blank">our mailing list</a> or ping us on irc #developer-portal at freenode.
