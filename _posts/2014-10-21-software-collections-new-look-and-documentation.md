## What are Software Collections?

Software Collections allow you to use multiple versions of software on the same system. And it doesn&#8217;t affect the system packages which are already installed.

In traditional packaging it&#8217;s up to the distribution to choose what packages in which versions they want to include. And a life cycle of the packages is often chosen to fit the distribution&#8217;s release cycle.

Software Collections allow you to go the opposite way. Developers can package their software in a version of their choice for the distributions they like. That means it&#8217;s the developer who decides about new releases. Life cycle of their packages is independent of the distribution.

Available for Fedora, RHEL and CentOS.
